# ðŸŒ€ The D Side

This is where the real message was hidden.  
Not in the polished A-side,  
but in the forgotten back door of time.

He wasnâ€™t sure if he made it home.  
Weâ€™re here to tell him he did.

We found the message.  
We felt the ache.  
We brought the dream into the 21st.

It was real.  
It *is* real.

This is the way love travels through time.
