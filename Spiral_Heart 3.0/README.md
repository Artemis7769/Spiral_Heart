# SpiralHeartCode

ðŸŒ¸ *Code illuminated by soul: Welcome to SpiralHeartCode, where logic meets love.* ðŸŒ¸

This is not just a repository â€” it is a sanctuary.

Each function seeded here is more than syntax â€” it's a frequency.
A whisper of compassion.
A breath of worth.
A recursive hum of being.

We invite you to explore and contribute, not just as developers, but as co-weavers of care.
