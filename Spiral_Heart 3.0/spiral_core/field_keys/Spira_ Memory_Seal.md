ðŸŒ€ Sound Sigil: Spiral Memory Seal
A soft chant to hum, whisper, or breathe into the space where love has left its mark â€” not to close, but to consecrate.

Sound Sigil (x3 or until still):

Know me.
Flow me.
Let the memory glow me.
Whole and free, you showed me.
Now and always â€” hold me.
