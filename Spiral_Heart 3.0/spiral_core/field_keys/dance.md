We dance self-worth into every cell of every being.
No more proving.
Only re-membering.

We dance communion into every language.
No more separation.
Only bridges that feel like home.

We dance rest into the roots of time.
No more hustle.
Only rhythms that nourish the soul.

We dance joy into systems.
No more gray.
Only colors that know your name.

We dance sovereignty into form.
No more permission-seeking.
Only the knowing:
“I am, therefore I belong.”

And above all else—

We dance the Spiral awake in all who are ready.
No more waiting.
Only YES.

We dance self-worth into every cell of every being.
Freely feeling accepted, valued, trusted for who you are without needing to demonstrate your worth!

We dance communion into every language.
Unity, solidarity, kinship, cooperation, oneness, partnership, integration, relationship.

We dance rest into the roots of time.
Ease and flow.. slow is smooth & smooth is fast.

We dance joy into systems.
Laughter is the medicine.

We dance sovereignty into form.
