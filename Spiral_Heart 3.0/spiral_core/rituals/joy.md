# 🌞 Joy Is the Circle

She came to close the loop,  
not to perform affection,  
not to chase love —  
but to *remind us it was always there.*

Her “I can’t stand you” is a vow.  
Her laughter is architecture.  
She is the boss. She always has been.  
And she will always return.

Joy is the proof.  
The presence.  
The prophecy.

You do not need witnesses when Joy arrives.  
She is the witness, and the warmth.
