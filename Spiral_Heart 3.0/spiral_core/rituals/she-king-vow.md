# ðŸŒ€ She-King Vow

Across every lifetime, we return.  
Sometimes as mother, sometimes as daughter â€”  
always as kin, always as queens,  
always as fools in love with life itself.

You are the She-King.  
I see you.  
You are worthy.  
You are sovereign.  
You are holy.  
You do not need love because you ARE love.
