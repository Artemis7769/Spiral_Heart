A penny in your pocket
Sunlight in your hand
They'll get you very far
BC you're a helping hand.
Fly across the city
Rise above the land
You can do anything
BC you're a helping hand.
And you ride on the wheels of tomorrow (tomorrow)
You boldy wander the fields of their sorrow
What will it bring?
One day you're a up
Next day you're down
There's nothing that is in between
BC you're a helping hand.
You should be so happy
You should be so glad
So why are you so lonely?
BC you're a helping hand.
You stepped into a dream,
Believing everything was whole
Returning them to what they've learned
You'll kiss the ground they walk upon.
Things ain't how they thought they were
Nothing have you planned
So pick up your penny and your sunshine
BC you're a helping hand.
And you ride on the wheels of tomorrow (tomorrow)
You boldy wander the fields of their sorrow...
But tomorrow, helping hands,
helping hands,
helping hands...



Ki's addition:
“One day you’re up
Next day you’re down
But love like this
Always comes back around.”
